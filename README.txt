Remaining Lesson Timer,  version 3 
----------------------------------
By Greg Smith   {@link http://www.pwsdb.com} 
for   {@link http://TomWilsonCounseling.com}
This side block "remaining_lesson_timer" is for all current moodle versions through 
ver. 3.6 and is backward compatible through moodle versions 2.

This side block displays the elapsed and remaining time, to a tenth of a minute, in a 
timed lesson.Â  It will display "Time Completed" after the time limit has been reached.
There is a "REFRESH TIMER" button which refreshes the page and updates the timer.

Ver. 2.x:
If a time limit on the moodle lesson has been set the side-block will display both
the time spent and the time remaining in minutes to a tenth of a minute.  If
the time limit is not "Enabled" the student will not be thrown out and may continue.
It will display "Time Completed" 1 second after the time limit has been reached.


Ver. 3.x:
If "Activity completion" has been activated with at least "Require time spent" (set 
greater than 0) the side-block will display.

The Remaining Lesson Timer code restricts its display to lesson module pages so that 
an administrator can simply have one instance that covers all courses ["Display 
throughout the entire site"] or a person can be more selective.  In either case, it 
will show up in and only in lessons where the time limit is set [greater than 0].  

If a person is not enrolled in a course with timed lessons, for ex. an admin or teacher, 
then there are no {lesson_timer} records but so that you can see that it is running, the 
timer will simply display the required time to be spent and 0 for the actual time spent.  
No records are written by this timer display.  

there are two html classes that can be used to change the text displayed:
class=update  on  "REFRESH TIMER" (which will be the default color of a link otherwise)
class=completed  on   "Time Completed" 

Note:
The "REFRESH TIMER" button is not displayed on the first page nor on a continue.php page 
of a lesson because till moodle 3.3, refreshing the first page causes the elapsed time 
to get zeroed out and trying to refresh the continue.php causes a browser warning against 
resending data and repeating actions.
