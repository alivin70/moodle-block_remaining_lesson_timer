Remaining Lesson Timer,  version 3 
----------------------------------
By Greg Smith   {@link http://www.pwsdb.com}

This side block "remaining_lesson_timer" is for all current moodle versions through 
ver. 3.5 and is backward compatible through moodle versions 2.

This side block displays the elapsed and remaining time, to a tenth of a minute, in a 
timed lesson.Â  It will display "Time Completed" after the time limit has been reached.
There is a "REFRESH TIMER" button which refreshes the page and updates the timer (same 
as the browser refresh button).

Ver. 2.x:
If a time limit on the moodle lesson has been set the side-block will display both
the time spent and the time remaining in minutes to a tenth of a minute.  If
the time limit is not "Enabled" the student will not be thrown out and may continue.
It will display "Time Completed" 1 second after the time limit has been reached.

Ver. 3.x:
If "Activity completion" has been activated with at least "Require time spent" (set 
greater than 0) the side-block will display.

The Remaining Lesson Timer only runs when called by lesson/view.php pages therefore an 
administrator can simply have one instance that covers all courses ["Display throughout 
the entire site"] or a person can be more selective.  In either case, it will run and 
show up in and only in lesson/view.php where the time limit is set [greater than 0].  

If an admin or teacher calls up a timed lesson/view.php page for editing (for example), 
then there are no {lesson_timer} records but the timer will simply display the required 
time to be spent and 0 for the actual time spent.  See printscreen.

there are two html classes that can be used to change the text displayed in the included 
styles.css:
class=minutestogo  on  "Time Remaining:..."
class=completed  on   "Time Completed" 
class=refresh  on  "REFRESH TIMER"
